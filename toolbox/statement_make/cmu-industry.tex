{\large \bf Industry Experience Statement for Carnegie Mellon Societal Computing PhD Application}
\end{center}

In addition to the systems I have built at UBC, I have experience building large scale systems over 2 internships spanning 8 months at LinkedIn. For both terms, I was a member of the distributed data systems team, working on Apache Kafka and Apache Samza pipeline integration with existing systems on the Voldemort team (distributed database) in 2014, and on the Online Relevance Infrastructure team in 2015. Over the course of my undergraduate degree at the University of Waterloo, I totaled 2 years of working experience at 4 different companies over 6 internships. Working with a wide variety of companies has helped me understand the various ways in which teams operate, ranging from large hierarchical structures at cloud companies such as LinkedIn, to fast paced informal structures at a 20 person startup company in Toronto.  \\

Following the conclusion of my Masters degree in December, I will be furthering my industry experience by spending 6 months working at Oasis Labs\footnote{\url{https://www.oasislabs.com/}}, an early stage privacy-preserving blockchain research startup founded by Professor Dawn Song from UC Berkeley. I am very excited for the opportunity to continue working with world-class people in a fast-paced environment and look forward to sharpening my skills in systems development, machine learning and security for my eventual PhD research. \\
